Coding Test
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward, an example of this is the name "Anna" or the sentence "Do not bob to nod". An anagram is a type of word play which is the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase an example of this is the words "silent" and "listen" are composed of the same letters.

Your task is to write a method which accepts a string as a parameter and returns a boolean. The method will return true if the string is a palindrome or an anagram of a palindrome otherwise it will return false.

Assumptions

The following are a set of assumptions that can be made about the data that is supplied to the method.

•	There will be no whitespace in the string.
•	All characters in the string will be lower case.
•	The string will only contain alpha characters a-z.

Solution required

A Windows console application that accepts a string and prints if it is:
1.	a palindrome,
2.	an anagram of a palindrome,
3.	or neither.

Tests

For bonus points, add unit tests for these scenarios:

•	"anna" will return true.
•	"aaaaaaaa" will return true.
•	"aaaaaaaab" will return true.
•	"caaaaaaaab" will return false.
•	"donotbobtonod" will return true.
•	"owefhijpfwai" will return false.
•	"igdedgide" will return true.

Language and IDE

We are open to your solving the problem in any language or IDE you prefer, however a Visual Studio C# console application would be helpful for us to assess.
